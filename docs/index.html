          <h1>
            Hi, I'm James (Jamie) Mottashed. Welcome to my portfolio!
          </h1>
          <p>
            I’m a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Birmingham, awarded the UK Excellence Scholarship for computer science. 
            I am passionate about building reliable and creative software solutions and my interests span software engineering, data analysis, and AI, with experience in Python, Java, and C. 
            I enjoy taking on ambitious projects — from developing interactive dashboards to designing full text-based games — and thrive on solving problems that require both precision and creativity. 
            Beyond coding, I’m a collaborative team player, having led projects, coached younger students in robotics, and captained my school’s rugby 1st XV. My long-term ambition is to apply my skills in technology to create impactful solutions, with an entrepreneurial mindset for the future.
            I’m actively seeking internships and project opportunities to apply my growing skillset to real‑world challenges.
